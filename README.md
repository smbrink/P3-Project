# P3-Project
P3 Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

I used a couple different scripts, some from the class and some for this project.

1. Count_Tags was from the class and used to count the number of tags in the dataset.

2. Street_Audit was from the class and used to audit the street names.

3. City_Check was for the project and used to look at the City names.

4. City_Count was for the project and used to count the number of times Wichita was misspelled as Witchita.

5. Create_Tables was for the project and used to create the tables in SQL.

6.
