# P3-Project
P3 Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

I used a couple different scripts, some from the class and some for this project.

1. Count_Tags is from the class and used to count the number of tags in the dataset.

2. Street_Audit is from the class and used to audit the street names.

3. City_Check is for the project and used to look at the City names.

4. City_Count is for the project and used to count the number of times Wichita was misspelled as Witchita.

5. Create_Tables is for the project and used to create the tables in SQL.

6. NanoDegree_P3.md & NanoDegree_P3.html are the reports detailing my Project.

7. Postcode_Audit is for the project and used to audit the postal codes.

8. Write_Data is from the class and used to fix the postal codes and streets as well as write the CSV files.
