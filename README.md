# P3-Project
P3 Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data

I used a couple different scripts, some from the class and some for this project.

1. Count_Tags was fron the class and used to count the number of tags in the dataset.

2. P3 Street Audit was from the class and used to audit the street names.

3. Update_Street was from the class and used to update the street names.

4. City_Check was for the project and used to look at the City names.

5. City_Count was for the project and used to count the number of times Wichita was misspelled as Witchita.
